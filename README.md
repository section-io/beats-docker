## section-io specifics
We forked a version of filebeats at v6.2.3.  In order to build an equivalent docker image
we need to also use the Dockerfile that created the v6.2.3 that Elastic produces.

The code below shows how to go about generating the Dockerfile along with the changes
to a number of files in this fork.

## Requirements
A full build and test requires:
* Docker
* GNU Make
* Python 3.5 with Virtualenv

## Supported Docker versions

The images have been tested on Docker 17.03.1-ce

## Running a build
To build images with a released version of Beats, check out the corresponding
branch for the version, and run Make while specifying the exact version desired.
Like this:
```
git checkout 6.3
ELASTIC_VERSION=6.3.1 make
```

To build images with the latest nightly snapshots of Beats, run:
```
make from-snapshot
```

## Contributing, issues and testing

Acceptance tests for the images are located in the `test` directory,
and can be invoked with `make test`. Python 3.5 is required to run the
tests. They are based on the
excellent [testinfra](http://testinfra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
which is itself based on
the wonderful [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/).

`beats-docker` is developed under a test-driven
workflow, so please refrain from submitting patches without test
coverage. If you are not familiar with testing in Python, please
raise an issue instead.

The images are built on [CentOS 7][centos-7].
